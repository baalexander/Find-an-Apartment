Below is a list of items to check when upgrading the app in the store. A few have burned me in the past.

* Change the bundle version in EACH app's Info.plist.

* Change the app version in constants.h.

* Clean all targets before final testing.

* Run Ad Hoc build. This will make sure static libraries are linked up properly in Distribution configuration as well as Debug.

* Confirm Google Maps key is correct.

* Confirm all URL constructors point to production.
